        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The Hotel  is located near Tiantan Park, just a 10-minute walk from the National Center for the Performing Arts and Tian'anmen Square. Built in 1956 it has old school charm and many rooms still feature high, crown-molded ceilings. A 2012 renovation brought all rooms and services up to modern day scratch and guestrooms come equipped with free Wi-Fi and all the usual amenities required for a comfortable stay.</p>
